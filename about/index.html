<h1><p>Thank you for visiting.</p></h1>

<h3>I am a 4th year graduate student in University of Kencutky. My two majors are biochemistry (PhD) and statistics (MA). The focus of my research is 
    NMR reference correction. Don't let the unfamiliar terms scare you. What I am doing, in simple words, is using the statistical methods and computational power
     to analyse biomolecular data.  </h3>
