# Do you want a website?

You are in luck. I just made this website with Jekyll and it's amazing! 

BUT, let me tell you some drawbacks that Jekyll statistic web have. For my website, I used two types of files, html and markdown.
You probably are familiar with the html, it can do literally anything you want, but it hard to learn and some of the functions may not be covertable with jekyll engine and it's hard to learn.
On the other side markdown is easy to learn and use but it has so many limitations, just like this post. You can display content, but for multimedia it's a no. For example the youtube video below:  

[![All I ask](http://img.youtube.com/vi/utNKjspT39I/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utNKjspT39I?autoplay=T "All I ask")

The only way you can kind of solve is wrapping the video link into a click-able picture. And the picture is the auto-generated picture from Youtube.
