This post is based on Jeff Heaton's Introduction to the Math of Neural Networks.

I have been always wonder what is exactly the neural network (NN) is. To simplify in one sentence, it's 
the collection of machine learnings represented in a network structure, and the neural part is just
 for fancy. 
 

So far, I have found out deep learning (DL) and NN are almost equivalent, so for this post I will use them interchangeable.
For the NN or DL, I believe math is the fundamental and for the books claim non-math NN or DL, they are diminishing our capability. Believe it or not, the math that is behind are not that
untenable at all. So sit still and let me amaze you that you too can master Deep Learning.
