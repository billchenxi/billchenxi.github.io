# Passed Another SAS exam!

So happy that I just passed the SAS Clinical Trial exam. 
I would like to talking about what I did and how I did. 

For any certificatione exams, braindumping simply doesn't work. If you underestimate the exam organizer, you are wrong. Don't be beguiled by the internet and do take efforts to study and practice.

Through your school you might eligible for free online courses issued by the SAS, which is my case, I did all the required courses for each exam, especially for the statistics 1, I took them twice just make sure I understand and master the skills. 
Looking back, it worths my time and energy to do so, since I aced the exam with 91%.

If you don't have the access to any of thos luxury online training, you can always download the lecture notes. If you have extra money to spend, do buy the official lecture note from the SAS store, but if you don't, there are a lot of pdf available online.
The exam is not hard, just very detailed. If you want more information, please leave a  message, and I will try to reply.

Cheers...
